## Nest - Framework for Node.js based server-side applications.

## What problem does it solve? Architecture.

Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture that allows developers to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.

Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

- Nest.js was created to help developers create Monoliths and Microservices.
- It’s simple to use, quick to learn, and easy to apply
- It leverages TypeScript — strongly typed language which is a superset of JavaScript
- Powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) to boost productivity and ease of development
- Support for dozens of nest-specific modules that help you easily integrate with common technologies and - concepts like Type ORM, Mongoose, GraphQL, Logging, Validation, Caching, WebSockets, and much more
- Easy unit-testing applications
- Great documentation.
- Built for large-scale enterprise applications.
